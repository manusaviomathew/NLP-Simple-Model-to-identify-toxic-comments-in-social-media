# NLP-Simple-Model-to-identify-toxic-comments-in-social-media
The Conversation AI team, a research initiative founded by Jigsaw and Google (both part of Alphabet), builds technology to protect voices in conversation. A main area of focus is machine learning models that can identify toxicity in online conversations, where toxicity is defined as anything rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion.

This project is an attempt to apply the Natural Language Processing Techniques to develop a model that can identify toxic comments.
